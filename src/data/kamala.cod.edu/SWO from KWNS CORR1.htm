CAM GUIDANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT INDICATING INITIAL &nbsp<br>STORM DEVELOPMENT OVER SERN MT/NWRN SD AND WRN ND AND LATEST &nbsp<br>RADAR/SATELLITE IMAGERY CONFIRM THIS DEVELOPMENT IS NOW OCCURRING &nbsp<br>NEAR THE SURFACE COLD FRONT.  STRONG DIABATIC HEATING AHEAD OF THESE &nbsp<br>STORMS IN THE WAKE OF THE EARLIER CONVECTIVELY-MODIFIED AIR MASS IS &nbsp<br>RESULTING IN FURTHER DESTABILIZATION WITHIN A FAVORABLY SHEARED &nbsp<br>ENVIRONMENT.  AS THESE STORMS MOVE NEWD INITIAL CELLS MAY GROW &nbsp<br>UPSCALE INTO A SEVERE MCS MOVING EWD/NEWD ACROSS ND TOWARD NWRN MN &nbsp<br>TONIGHT.  ALL SEVERE HAZARDS WILL BE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY DURING &nbsp<br>THE FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER CONVECTIVE INITIATION...WITH THE PRIMARY &nbsp<br>THREAT TRANSITIONING TO DAMAGING WIND GUSTS AND LARGE HAIL LATER &nbsp<br>THIS EVENING INTO TONIGHT ACROSS CENTRAL/ERN ND INTO NWRN MN.   &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>FARTHER SOUTH...ELEVATED STORMS OVER CENTRAL SD CONTINUE TO MOVE &nbsp<br>NEWD WITH LITTLE SIGNS OF INTENSIFICATION UP TO NOW...WITH OTHER &nbsp<br>STORMS EVIDENT OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL SD.  THE LATTER STORMS...LOCATED &nbsp<br>CLOSE TO THE SURFACE BOUNDARY MAY STRENGTHEN FURTHER OVER THE NEXT &nbsp<br>FEW HOURS AS THEY MOVE NEWD.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE &nbsp<br>EVOLUTION OF THESE CONVECTIVE BANDS AS OPERATIONAL AND PARALLEL HRRR &nbsp<br>VERSIONS SUGGEST ADDITIONAL STRONG/SEVERE STORMS WILL &nbsp<br>DEVELOP/PROGRESS NEWD FROM CENTRAL AND NERN SD INTO SERN ND THROUGH &nbsp<br>THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE INTO NWRN/WEST CENTRAL MN TONIGHT.  THE &nbsp<br>SLGT RISK AREA HAS BEEN EXPANDED EWD INTO CENTRAL MN TO ACCOUNT FOR &nbsp<br>THIS POTENTIAL TONIGHT. &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>OTHERWISE...THE MARGINAL RISK AREA IN THE SOUTHEAST HAS BEEN &nbsp<br>ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE MUCH OF AR WHERE STRONG STORMS ARE DEVELOPING &nbsp<br>WITHIN THE MID-LEVEL SHEAR ZONE.  WEAK FLOW ALOFT AND MINIMAL SHEAR &nbsp<br>FAVOR PULSE CONVECTIVE MODES ACROSS THE LARGE REGION WITH POTENTIAL &nbsp<br>FOR BRIEF MICROBURSTS OCCURRING DURING THE UPDRAFT COLLAPSE PHASE. &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>..WEISS.. 07/10/2016 &nbsp<br><FONT COLOR=#003366><B>&nbsp &nbsp<br>PREV DISCUSSION</B></FONT> &nbsp<br> /ISSUED 1123 AM CDT SUN JUL 10 2016/ &nbsp<br><FONT COLOR=#003366><B>&nbsp &nbsp<br>..NRN PLAINS THROUGH TONIGHT</B></FONT> &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN IS CHARACTERIZED BY A WELL-DEFINED MIDLEVEL &nbsp<br>TROUGH OVER THE PAC NW...A LOW-AMPLITUDE RIDGE OVER THE PLAINS...AND &nbsp<br>A WEAKER DOWNSTREAM TROUGH OVER NEW ENGLAND.  THE PAC NW TROUGH WILL &nbsp<br>PROGRESS EWD TO THE NRN HIGH PLAINS BY TONIGHT...WITH ASSOCIATED &nbsp<br>CYCLOGENESIS ANTICIPATED FROM SW SD TODAY INTO ND TONIGHT.  THE &nbsp<br>SURFACE PATTERN HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY OUTFLOW FROM AN OVERNIGHT &nbsp<br>MCS THAT IS NOW MOVING SEWD ACROSS IA...AND ADDITIONAL ELEVATED &nbsp<br>STORMS OVER ERN SD CONTINUE TO REINFORCE THE COLD POOL.  THERE WILL &nbsp<br>BE GRADUAL RECOVERY OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER FROM CENTRAL SD INTO ND &nbsp<br>THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...WITH SOME WWD ADVECTION OF LOW-LEVEL &nbsp<br>MOISTURE EXPECTED INTO SE MT TO THE N OF THE SURFACE CYCLONE. &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS AWAY FROM THE ONGOING CONVECTION STILL SHOWED &nbsp<br>VERY STEEP MIDLEVEL LAPSE RATES WITH A WARM ELEVATED MIXED LAYER.  &nbsp<br>GIVEN THE INFLUENCE OF THE MORNING CONVECTION...TWO SCENARIOS SEEM &nbsp<br>PROBABLE AND ARE SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF CONVECTION-PERMITTING &nbsp<br>GUIDANCE FOR LATE AFTERNOON.  THE FIRST POSSIBILITY IS FOR SOMEWHAT &nbsp<br>HIGH-BASED STORMS TO DEVELOP MID-LATE AFTERNOON NEAR OR JUST E OF &nbsp<br>THE TRIPLE POINT IN S CENTRAL SD...ON THE NOSE OF THE WARMEST &nbsp<br>SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND DEEPEST MIXING.  THIS CONVECTION SHOULD &nbsp<br>THEN SPREAD EWD/NEWD WITH AN ATTENDANT RISK FOR DAMAGING WINDS AND &nbsp<br>HAIL.  A SEPARATE BROKEN BAND OF CONVECTION WILL LIKELY FORM ALONG &nbsp<br>OR JUST AHEAD OF THE BAROCLINIC ZONE ACROSS SE MT...WHERE &nbsp<br>WEAK-MODERATE BUOYANCY AND STRONG DEEP-LAYER VERTICAL SHEAR WILL &nbsp<br>FAVOR SUPERCELLS WITH LARGE HAIL/DAMAGING WINDS.  THE TORNADO RISK &nbsp<br>WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE DEGREE OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTENING INTO SW ND &nbsp<br>AND SE MT BY THIS EVENING...WHEN SEMI-DISCRETE STORMS ARE EXPECTED. &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>OVERNIGHT...UPSCALE GROWTH OF CONVECTION INTO AN MCS APPEARS &nbsp<br>PROBABLE ACROSS ND...POSSIBLY THROUGH MERGERS OF THE SE MT/SW ND &nbsp<br>STORMS AND ANY CONVECTION THAT EXPANDS NEWD FROM CENTRAL SD LATE &nbsp<br>THIS EVENING.  DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL WILL BE THE MAIN &nbsp<br>CONCERNS OVERNIGHT. &nbsp<br><FONT COLOR=#003366><B>&nbsp &nbsp<br>..LOWER MS VALLEY AND SE STATES THIS AFTERNOON</B></FONT> &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br>SCATTERED PULSE STORMS ARE EXPECTED AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE &nbsp<br>SLOW-MOVING FRONT ACROSS SC...AND ALONG LINGERING DIFFERENTIAL &nbsp<br>HEATING ZONES AND CONVECTIVE OUTFLOWS FARTHER W INTO MS.  &nbsp<br>MODERATE-STRONG BUOYANCY IS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AS SURFACE &nbsp<br>TEMPERATURES WARM TO AOA 90 F WITH BOUNDARY LAYER DEWPOINTS OF 70-75 &nbsp<br>F.  THE COMBINATION OF WATER LOADING AND DCAPE AOA 1000 J/KG WILL &nbsp<br>SUPPORT THE RISK FOR A FEW WET MICROBURSTS THIS AFTERNOON. &nbsp<br> &nbsp<br><hr> &nbsp<br>&nbsp;<br><B><PRE><FONT color=#003366 face="lucida sans typewriter, lucidas console, courier" ><A HREF="http://kamala.cod.edu/offs/KWNS/acus01.chunk.html">CLICK HERE TO GO TO PREVIOUS BULLETINS.</A></FONT></B>
